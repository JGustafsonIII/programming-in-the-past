# Theory of Programming Languages

## Programming in the Past

### Goals:

- To enjoy a simple programming assignment done in a variety of early procedural
  programming languages.
- To re?lect on this experience though a consulting log.
- To facilitate discussions about programming and languages.

### Tasks:

- Develop a set of functions that will allow you to encrypt a string using a Caesar cipher.
- Develop a set of functions that will allow you to decrypt a string using a Caesar cipher.
- Develop a set of functions that will help you to solve (break) a Caesar cipher.

#### Implement all of the above functions for all of the following languages:

- Encrypt, Decrypt, Solve in Fortran
- Encrypt, Decrypt, Solve in COBOL
- Encrypt, Decrypt, Solve in BASIC 1
- Encrypt, Decrypt, Solve in Pascal
- Encrypt, Decrypt, Solve in Scala (in a procedural manner)
